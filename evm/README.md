# EVM ROADMAP

This document is a roadmap for the EVM learning resources. It is a living document and will be updated as new resources are added.

## Before you start

I would recommend you to go through the following resources before you start with the EVM.

- [What is Stack?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNZ5o9S9prU)
- [What is Virtual Machine?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daDbY2iDmU0)
- [Why study EVM?](https://medium.com/@danielyamagata/understand-evm-opcodes-write-better-smart-contracts-e64f017b619)

## EVM through Illustrations

This is a pdf [Last updated in March 2018] that provides a high level overview of the EVM process. It is a great resource for those who are new to EVM and want to understand the process in a visual way.

## Explaination of the Illustrations in the EVM through Illustrations

This is a YouTube video that explains the EVM through Illustrations. It is a great resource for those who want to understand the working of EVM properly.

## EVM CODES

This is an interactive reference for the Solidity Developers who want to know more about the OP Codes and their gas expenses.

## Contract ABI and Bytecode

For digging deeper into the EVM, it is important to understand the contract ABI and Bytecode. This is a great blog for those who want to understand the contract ABI and Bytecode.

## Storage in Contracts

- [Data Locations in Solidity](https://betterprogramming.pub/solidity-tutorial-all-about-data-locations-dabd33212471) - This is a great blog to start learning about the data locations in Solidity.
- [All About Memory](https://betterprogramming.pub/solidity-tutorial-all-about-memory-1e1696d71ee4) - This is a great blog to learn about `the memory` in Solidity.

## DEEP DIVES Series

- The first blog is about the working of the EVM using **Bytecodes and OPCODES.** Check it [here.](https://medium.com/@danielyamagata/understand-evm-opcodes-write-better-smart-contracts-e64f017b619)

- The second blog is about the **Memory** in Soldity. How does it stores the values using OPCODES and Pointer. Check it [here.](https://noxx.substack.com/p/evm-deep-dives-the-path-to-shadowy-d6b)
